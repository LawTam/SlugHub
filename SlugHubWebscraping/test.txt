@app.route("/SlugHub", methods= ['GET']))

def respond_request():
	if request.method == 'GET':
		# Send response in JSON to client
		# Read content of file and send it to the client
		# Use jsonify on created dictionary
		# Return resonse to client
		# De-jsonify and convert to list
		# Parse JSON response and show it as a table
		# Get HTML page and parse it

1. (Offline) Compute the course dictionary by parsing HTML and write into file (X)
2. Send a request to the SlugHub endpoint
3. SlugHub endpoint scans file and returns result to client
4. Client application shows it to the user
5. Create a new endpoint (such as update_file) which is the python code that generates the file
@app.route("/Update_file", methods = ['GET'])

# Whenever want to update information, do it using curl

# Send get request to update file
# Python code updates file
# Sends request to slughub and retriweves that information


get = retrieve information
put = store information
post = store new information
